# Bamazon
An Amazon-like storefront to showcase MySQL skills

## Overview

I have created an Amazon-like storefront to showcase MySQL skills.
The app takes in orders from customers and depletes the stock from the store's inventory. 
The app uses Inquirer to prompt the customer as to how they wish to proceed.

## NPM Packages Used
1. MySQL
2. Inquirer

## Workflow
1. The customer will enter the store by typing `node bamazonCustomer.js` in the console. 
Customer is then presented with the store's inventory and asked which product they wish to purchase.
