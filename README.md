An Amazon-like storefront to showcase MySQL skills

## Overview

I have created an Amazon-like storefront to showcase MySQL skills.
The app will:
    * Take in orders from customers
    * Deplete stock from the store's inventory. 
    * Track product sales across the store's departments 
    * Provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

## NPM Packages Used
1. MySQL
2. Inquirer
